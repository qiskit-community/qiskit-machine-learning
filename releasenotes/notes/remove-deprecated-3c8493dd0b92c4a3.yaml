    Removed support of the deprecated parameter `quantum_instance` in the constructor of
    :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.VQC` and in :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.VQR`.
    Please use `sampler` and `estimator` respectively. Refer to the
    `migration guide <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/machine-learning/migration/01_migration_guide_0.5.html>`__
    for more information.

    Since :mod:`qiskit.opflow` and :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance` are deprecated in Qiskit,
    Qiskit Machine Learning classes based on the deprecated Qiskit classes have been
    removed:

      - Class :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.SamplingNeuralNetwork` is removed and
        has no direct replacement as this is a base class.

      - Class :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.CircuitQNN` is removed and
        is superseded by :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.SamplerQNN`.

      - Class :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.OpflowQNN` is removed and
        is superseded by :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.EstimatorQNN`.

      - Class :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.TwoLayerQNN` is removed and
        has no direct replacement. Please make use of
        :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.EstimatorQNN` instead.

      - Class :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.QuantumKernel` is removed and
        is superseded by :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.FidelityQuantumKernel`,
        :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.TrainableFidelityQuantumKernel`, and
        :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.FidelityStatevectorKernel`.

    Please refer to the
    `migration guide <https://qiskit.org/ecosystem/machine-learning/migration/01_migration_guide_0.5.html>`__
    on how to replace the deprecated classes with new ones.
