    A base class ``TrainableModel`` is introduced for machine learning models. This class follows
    Sckikit-Learn principles and makes the quantum machine learning compatible with classical
    models. Both ``NeuralNetworkClassifier`` and ``NeuralNetworkRegressor`` extend this class.
    A base class ``ObjectiveFunction`` is introduced for objective functions optimized by machine
    learning models. There are three objective functions introduced that are used by ML models:
    ``BinaryObjectiveFunction``, ``MultiClassObjectiveFunction``, and ``OneHotObjectiveFunction``.
    These functions are used internally by the models.
