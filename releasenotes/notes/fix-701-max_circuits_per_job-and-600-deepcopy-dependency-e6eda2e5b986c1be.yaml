fixes:
  - |
    Added a `max_circuits_per_job` parameter to the :class:`.FidelityQuantumKernel` used
    in the case that if more circuits are submitted than the job limit for the 
    backend, the circuits are split up and run through separate jobs.
  - |    
    Removed :class:`.QuantumKernelTrainer`dependency on `copy.deepcopy` that was
    throwing an error with real backends. Now, it creates a new `instance`
    of the :class:`.QuantumKernelTrainer` and assigns parameters manually.
