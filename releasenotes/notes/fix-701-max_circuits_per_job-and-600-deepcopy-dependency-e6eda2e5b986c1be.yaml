    #701 Added a max_circuits_per_job parameter to fidelity quantum kernel used
    in the case that if more circuits are submitted than the job limit for the 
    backend, the circuits are split up and ran through separate jobs.
    #600 Removed quantum kernel trainers dependency on copy.deepcopy that was
    throwing an error with real backends. Now, it creates a new instance
    of the class and assign parameters manually.
