    The FidelityQuantumKernel cannot be executed on the hardware for larger
    problems. #701
    There is a problem with the way _get_kernel_entries handles the jobs sent
    to hardware. max_circuits_per_job is half of the kernel size, which is 
    not suitable for the real hardware for larger problems.

    #701: Added a max_circuits_per_job parameter to fidelity quantum kernel used
    in the case that if more circuits are submitted than the job limit for the 
    backend, the circuits are split up and ran through separate jobs. 
    Documentation was added and formatted for this.
