    This release note solves two issues : 
    
    * Previously in the :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.QuantumGenerator` of 
    the :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.QGAN` algorithm, if we used
    a simulator other than the `statevector_simulator` the result dictionary had not the 
    correct size to compute both the gradient and the loss functions. Now, 
    the `values` output are stored in a vector of size `2^n` and each key is mapped 
    to its value from the result dictionary in the new value array. Also, each key 
    is stored in a vector of size 2^n where each element of the vector `keys[i]` 
    corresponds to the binary representation of `i`. 
    * Previously in the :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.QuantumGenerator` of 
    the :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.QGAN` algorithm, the gradients were
    computed using the `statevector` backend even if we specified another backend. To solve
    this issue, the gradient object is converted into a `CircuitStateFn` instead of its adjoint 
    as in the previous version. The gradients are converted into the backend-dependent structure using 
    `CircuitSampler`. After the evaluation of the object, the `gradient_function` is stored in a 
    dense array to fix a dimension incompatibility when computing the loss function.
