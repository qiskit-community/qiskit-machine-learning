    The ``optimizer`` argument for the classes ``NeuralNetworkClassifier`` and 
    ``NeuralNetworkRegressor``, both of which extends the ``TrainableModel`` 
    class, is made optional with the default value being ``SLSQP()``. The same
    is true for the classes ``VQC`` and ``VQR`` as they inherit from 
    ``NeuralNetworkClassifier`` and ``NeuralNetworkRegressor`` respectively.

    This fixes the exception that occurs when no ``optimizer`` argument is
    passed to ``NeuralNetworkClassifier`` and ``NeuralNetworkRegressor``.
