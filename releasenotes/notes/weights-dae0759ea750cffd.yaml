    Added two new properties to the :class:`~.TrainableModel` class:
      - :attr:`~.TrainableModel.fit_result` returns a resulting object from the optimization procedure. Please refers to
        the Terra's documentation of the `OptimizerResult` class. 
      - :attr:`~.TrainableModel.weights` returns an array of trained weights, this is a convenient way to get access to 
        the weights, it is the same as calling ``model.fit_result.x``.
