    The method :meth:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.TrainableModel.fit` is not abstract 
    any more. Now, it implements basic checks, keeps track of the 
    :attr:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.TrainableModel.fit_result` property, and calls 
    a new abstract method :meth:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.TrainableModel._fit_internal` 
    internally. Thus, any sub-class of :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.TrainableModel` 
    must implement this new method. Classes 
    :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.NeuralNetworkClassifier` and 
    :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.NeuralNetworkRegressor` have been updated 
    correspondingly.
