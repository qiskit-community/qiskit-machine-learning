    Introduced a new classification algorithm, which is an alternative version of the Quantum
    Support Vector Classifier (QSVC) that is trained via the Pegasos algorithm from 
    https://home.ttic.edu/~nati/Publications/PegasosMPB.pdf instead of the dual optimization problem
    like in sklearn. This algorithm yields a training complexity that is independent of the size of
    the training set (see the to be published Master's Thesis "Comparing Quantum Neural Networks and
    Quantum Support Vector Machines" by Arne Thomsen), such that the PegasosQSVC is expected to
    train faster than QSVC for sufficiently large training sets.
