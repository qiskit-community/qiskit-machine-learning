    QKT deepcopy kernel internally, fails with runtime primitives #600
    On line 202, the quantum kernel trainer deepcopy, which is incompatible 
    with the runtime primitives, as they do not support deepcopy. If you try 
    to run it, a recursion error is raised. (this does not happen with the 
    Terra reference or Aer primitives)

fixes:
  - |
    Removed quantum kernel trainers dependency on copy.deepcopy that was
    throwing an error with real backends. Now create a new instance
    of a class and assign parameters manually. As change is purely 
    internal, no new documentation required.
