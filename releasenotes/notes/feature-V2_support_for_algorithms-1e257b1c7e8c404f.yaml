      Extended support for V2 primitives across various quantum machine learning algorithms
      including :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.VQC`, 
      :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.VQR`,
      :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.QSVC`, 
      :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.QSVR`,
      and :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.QBayesian`. If no version specification is provided,
      these algorithms will default to using V1 primitives as a fallback for this release.
      A warning is now issued to inform users of this default behavior.
