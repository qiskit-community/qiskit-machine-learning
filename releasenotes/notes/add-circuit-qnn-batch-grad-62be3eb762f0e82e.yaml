    In the previous releases at the backpropagation stage of ``CircuitQNN`` gradients were computed
    for each sample in a dataset individually and then the obtained values were aggregated into
    one output array. Thus, for each sample in a dataset at least one job was submitted. Now,
    gradients are computed for all samples in a dataset in one go by passing a list of values for
    a single parameter to ``CircuitSampler``. Therefore, a number of jobs required for such
    computations is significantly reduced. This improvements may speed up training process in the
    cloud environment, where queueing time for submitting a job may be a major contribution in the
    overall training time.
