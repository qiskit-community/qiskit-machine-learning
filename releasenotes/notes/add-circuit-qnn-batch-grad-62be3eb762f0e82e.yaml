    In the previous releases at the backpropagation stage of ``CircuitQNN`` and ``OpflowQNN``
    gradients were computed for each sample in a dataset individually and then the obtained values
    were aggregated into one output array. Thus, for each sample in a dataset at least one job was
    submitted. Now, gradients are computed for all samples in a dataset in one go by passing a
    list of values for a single parameter to ``CircuitSampler``. Therefore, a number of jobs
    required for such computations is significantly reduced. This improvement may speed up
    training process in the cloud environment, where queue time for submitting a job may be
    a major contribution in the overall training time.
