    The :func:`~qiskit_machine_learning.datasets.h_molecule_evolution_data` function has 
    been added. This dataset generator simulates time evolution of Hydrogen-based molecules 
    (H₂, H₃) under their electronic Hamiltonians using quantum simulation. It supports 
    realistic noise models from IBM Quantum backends and can be used to benchmark 
    variational fast-forwarding algorithms.

    Example of a 4-qubit H₂ dataset in noiseless statevector format is below.

    .. code-block:: python

        h_molecule_evolution_data(
            delta_t=1.0,
            train_end=5,
            test_start=10,
            test_end=15,
            molecule="H2",
            noise_mode="noiseless",
            formatting="statevector"
        )
