deprecations:
  - |
    The valid values passed to the loss argument of the ``TrainableModel`` constructor were partially
    deprecated (i.e. ``loss='l1'`` is replaced with ``loss='absolute_error'`` and ``loss='l2'`` is 
    replaced with ``loss='squared_error'``). This affects instantiation of classes like the
    ``NeuralNetworkClassifier``. This change was made to reduce confusion that stems from using
    lowercase 'l' character which can be mistaken for a numeric '1' or capital 'I'. You should
    update your model instantiations by replacing 'l1' with 'absolute_error' and 'l2' with 
    'squared_error'.
