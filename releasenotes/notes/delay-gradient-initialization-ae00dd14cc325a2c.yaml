    Gradient operator/circuit initialization in
    :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.OpflowQNN` and
    :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.CircuitQNN` respectively is now delayed until
    the first call of the ``backward`` method. Thus, the networks are created faster and gradient
    framework objects are not created until they are required.
