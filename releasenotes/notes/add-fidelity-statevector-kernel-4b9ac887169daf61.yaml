    Added a new :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.kernels.FidelityStatevectorKernel` class that is
    optimized to use only statevector-implemented feature maps. Therefore, computational complexity
    is reduced from :math:`O(N^2)` to :math:`O(N)`.

    Computed statevector arrays are also cached to further increase efficiency unless. This cache is
    cleared when the ``evaluate`` method is called, unless ``auto_clear_cache`` is ``False``. The
    cache is unbounded by default, but its size can be set by the user, i.e., limited to the number
    of samples in the worst case.

    By default the Terra reference ``Statevector`` is used, however, the type can be specified via
    the ``statevector_type`` argument.

    An example of using this class is as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

        from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
        from sklearn.svm import SVC

        from qiskit.circuit.library import ZZFeatureMap
        from qiskit.quantum_info import Statevector

        from qiskit_machine_learning.kernels import FidelityStatevectorKernel

        # generate a simple dataset
        features, labels = make_blobs(
            n_samples=20, centers=2, center_box=(-1, 1), cluster_std=0.1
        )

        feature_map = ZZFeatureMap(feature_dimension=2, reps=2)
        statevector_type = Statevector

        kernel = FidelityStatevectorKernel(
            feature_map=feature_map,
            statevector_type=Statevector,
            cache_size=len(labels),
            auto_clear_cache=True,
        )
        svc = SVC(kernel=kernel.evaluate)
        svc.fit(features, labels)
