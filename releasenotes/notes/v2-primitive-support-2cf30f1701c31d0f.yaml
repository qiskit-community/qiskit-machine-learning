    **Support for V2 Primitives**:
    The `EstimatorQNN` and `SamplerQNN` classes now support `V2` primitives
    (`EstimatorV2` and `SamplerV2`), allowing direct execution on IBM Quantum backends.
    This enhancement ensures compatibility with Qiskit IBM Runtime’s Primitive Unified
    Block (PUB) requirements and instruction set architecture (ISA) constraints for
    circuits and observables. Users can switch between `V1` primitives
    and `V2` primitives from version `0.8`. From version `0.9`, V1 primitives will be
    removed.

upgrade:
  - |
    Users working with real backends are advised to migrate to `V2` primitives
    (`EstimatorV2` and `SamplerV2`) to ensure compatibility with Qiskit IBM Runtime
    hardware requirements. These `V2` primitives will become the standard in
    the `0.8` release going forward, while `V1` primitives are deprecated.

deprecations:
  - |
    **Deprecated V1 Primitives**:
    The `V1` primitives (e.g., `EstimatorV1` and `SamplerV1`) are no longer compatible
    with real quantum backends via Qiskit IBM Runtime. This update provides initial
    transitional support, but `V1` primitives may be fully deprecated and removed in
    version `0.9`. Users should adopt `V2` primitives for both local and hardware
    executions to ensure long-term compatibility.

known_issues:
  - |
    **Optimizer compatibility may be unstable**:
    Current implementations of `EstimatorQNN` and `SamplerQNN` using `V2` primitives
    may require further testing with optimizers, especially those depending on gradient
    calculations. Users are advised to use optimizers with caution and report any
    issues related to optimizer compatibility in Qiskit Machine Learning’s issue tracker.
