    From this release, Qiskit Machine Learning requires Qiskit `1.0` or above, with important
    changes and upgrades, such as the introduction of Quantum Bayesian inference and the migration
    of a subset of Qiskit Algorithms features to Qiskit Machine Learning. These changes are
    part of the process to build full compatibility with the version-2 Qiskit primitives, to be
    introduced in version `0.9` of Qiskit Machine Learning in Q4 of 2024.
