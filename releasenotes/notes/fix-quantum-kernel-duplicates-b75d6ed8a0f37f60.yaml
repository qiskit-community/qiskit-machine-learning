    Introduced a new parameter `evaluate_duplicates` in
    :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.QuantumKernel`. This parameter defines a strategy how
    kernel matrix elements are evaluated if identical samples are found. The parameter does not
    apply on the statevector simulator. Possible values are:
      - ``all`` means that all kernel matrix elements are evaluated, even the diagonal
          ones when training. This may introduce additional noise in the matrix.
      - ``non_diagonal`` when training the matrix diagonal is set to `1`, the rest
          elements are fully evaluated, e.g., for two identical samples in the
          dataset. When inferring, all elements are evaluated. This is the default
          value.
      - ``none`` when training the diagonal is set to `1` and if two identical samples
          are found in the dataset the corresponding matrix element is set to `1`.
          When inferring, matrix elements for identical samples are set to `1`.

    Fixed quantum kernel evaluation when duplicate samples are found in the dataset. Originally,
    kernel matrix elements were not evaluated for identical samples in the dataset and such elements
    were set wrongly to zero. Now we introduced a new parameter `evaluate_duplicates` that ensures
    that elements of the kernel matrix are evaluated correctly. See the feature section for more
    details.
