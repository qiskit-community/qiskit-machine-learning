  Qiskit Machine Learning has been migrated to the `qiskit-community Github organization
  <https://github.com/qiskit-community>`_ to further emphasize that it is a community-driven project.

  To reflect this change, and because we are onboarding additional code-owners and maintainers,
  with this version (0.7) we have decided to *remove all deprecated* code, regardless of the time of its deprecation.
  This ensures that the new members of the development team do not have a large bulk of legacy code to maintain.

  This can mean one of two things for you as the end-user:

    #. Nothing, if you already migrated your code and no longer rely on any deprecated features.
    #. Otherwise, you should make sure that your workflow doesn't rely on deprecated classes. If you cannot do that,
       or want to continue using some of the features that were removed, you should pin your version of
       Qiskit Machine Learning to 0.6.
