upgrade:
  - |
    The previously deprecated `qgan` and `runtime` packages have been removed. Please refer to:

      - New `QGAN tutorial <https://qiskit.org/documentation/machine-learning/tutorials/04_torch_qgan.html>`__
        to train a generative quantum neural network.
      - New primitive based quantum neural networks :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.EstimatorQNN`,
        :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.SamplerQNN`, PyTorch connector
        :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.connectors.TorchConnector`, and
        `Qiskit Runtime Service <https://qiskit.org/documentation/partners/qiskit_ibm_runtime/apidocs/runtime_service.html>`__
        to get functionality similar to what the removed `runtime` package provided.
