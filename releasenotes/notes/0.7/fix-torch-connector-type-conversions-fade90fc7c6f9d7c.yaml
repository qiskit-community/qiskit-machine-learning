    Fixed incorrect type conversions in :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.connectors.TorchConnector`.
    The bug was causing the connector to convert the output to the same type as the input data.
    As a result, when an integer tensor was passed, the output would also be converted to an integer
    tensor, leading to rounding errors.
