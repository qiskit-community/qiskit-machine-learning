    Fixed an issue where calculating the Effective Dimension for an `EstimatorQNN` 
    would produce NaN values when the model outputs were negative (e.g., when using 
    PauliZ observables that can yield negative expectation values). The 
    `get_fisher_information` method now clamps negative or zero model outputs to a 
    small positive epsilon before computing the square root, ensuring the Fisher 
    Information Matrix calculation completes successfully without NaN values.
