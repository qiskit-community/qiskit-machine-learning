    Introduced Quantum Kernels based on (runtime) primitives. This implementation leverages the
    fidelity primitive (see :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.state_fidelities.BaseStateFidelity`) and
    provides more flexibility to end users. The fidelity primitive calculates state
    fidelities/overlaps for pairs of quantum circuits and requires an instance of
    :class:`~qiskit.primitives.Sampler`. Thus, users may plug in their own implementations of
    fidelity calculations.

    The new kernels expose the same interface and the same parameters except the `quantum_instance`
    parameter. This parameter does not have a direct replacement and instead the `fidelity`
    parameter must be used.

    A new hierarchy is introduced:

      - A base and abstract class :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.BaseKernel` is
        introduced. All concrete implementation must inherit this class.
      - A fidelity based quantum kernel
        :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.FidelityQuantumKernel` is added. This is a direct
        replacement of :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.QuantumKernel`. The difference is
        that the new class takes either a sampler or a fidelity instance to estimate overlaps and
        construct kernel matrix.
      - A new abstract class :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.TrainableKernel` is
        introduced to generalize ability to train quantum kernels.
      - A fidelity-based trainable quantum kernel
        :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.TrainableFidelityQuantumKernel` is introduced. This
        is a replacement of the existing :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.QuantumKernel` if
        a trainable kernel is required. The trainer
        :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.algorithms.QuantumKernelTrainer` now accepts both
        quantum kernel implementations, the new one and the existing one.

    The existing algorithms such as :class`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.QSVC`,
    :class`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.QSVR` and other kernel-based algorithms are updated
    to accept both implementation.

    For example a QSVM classifier can be trained as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit.algorithms.state_fidelities import ComputeUncompute
      from qiskit.circuit.library import ZZFeatureMap
      from qiskit.primitives import Sampler
      from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

      from qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms import QSVC
      from qiskit_machine_learning.kernels import FidelityQuantumKernel

      # generate a simple dataset
      features, labels = make_blobs(n_samples=20, centers=2, center_box=(-1, 1), cluster_std=0.1)

      # fidelity is optional and quantum kernel will create it automatically if none is passed
      fidelity = ComputeUncompute(sampler=Sampler())

      feature_map = ZZFeatureMap(2)
      kernel = FidelityQuantumKernel(feature_map=feature_map, fidelity=fidelity)
      qsvc = QSVC(quantum_kernel=kernel)
      qsvc.fit(features, labels)
