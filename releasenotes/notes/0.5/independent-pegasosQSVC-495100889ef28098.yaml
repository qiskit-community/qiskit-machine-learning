    Calling `PegasosQSVC.decision_function()` raises an error. Fixed by writing
    own method instead of inheriting from `SVC`. The inheritance from `SVC` in
    the `PegasosQSVC` class is removed. To keep the `score` method, inheritance
    to the mixin class `ClassifierMixin` from scikit-learn is added.

    Inheriting from `sklearn.svm.SVC` in `PegasosQSVC` resulted in errors when calling some 
    inherited methods such as `decision_function` due to the overridden `fit` implementation. 
    For that reason, the inheritance has been replaced by a much lighter inheritance
    from `ClassifierMixin` providing the `score` method and a new method `decision_function`
    has been implemented. The class is still `sklearn` compatible due to duck typing.
    This means that for the user everything that has been working in the previous
    release still works, except the inheritance. The only methods that are no longer 
    supported (such as `predict_proba`) were only raising errors in the previous release 
    in practice.
