    The :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.datasets.entanglement_concentration_data` class has 
    been added. This is a dataset generator that gives quantum states from two different 
    circuits with different levels of concentration of entanglement. Refer to the 
    documentation for more detailed information. 

    Example of a 4-qubit dataset:

    .. code-block:: python
    
        entanglement_concentration_data(
            training_size=1000,
            test_size=200,
            n=4,
            mode="easy",
            formatting="statevector"
        )
