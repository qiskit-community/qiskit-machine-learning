deprecations:
  - |
    The :mod:`qiskit.opflow` and :class:`~qiskit.utils.QuantumInstance` based classes have been deprecated:

      - Class :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.CircuitQNN` is deprecated and
        is superseded by :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.SamplerQNN`.22

      - Class :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.OpflowQNN` is deprecated and
        is superseded by :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.EstimatorQNN`.

      - Class :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.TwoLayerQNN` is deprecated and
        has no direct replacement. Please make use of
        :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.EstimatorQNN` instead.

      - Class :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.QuantumKernel` is deprecated and
        is superseded by :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.FidelityQuantumKernel`,
        :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.TrainableFidelityQuantumKernel`, and
        :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.kernels.FidelityStatevectorKernel`.

    The above mentioned classes will be removed no sooner than 3 months after the release.
