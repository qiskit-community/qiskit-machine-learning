deprecations:
  - |
    Qiskit has deprecated circuit library classes that were based on
    `BlueprintCircuit` in favor of methods that construct the circuits
    instead. However, with these methods, the number of qubits
    cannot be adjusted later. So for example `RealAmplitudes` class is
    replaced by `real_amplitudes` method, ZZFeatureMap` by
    `zz_feature_map` etc.

    As BlueprintCircuit will be removed from Qiskit, similarly based classes
    in Qiskit Machine Learning are now deprecated. These classes are
    :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.circuit.library.QNNCircuit` and
    :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.circuit.library.RawFeatureVector` where
    similarly their replacements are the like-named methods
    :meth:`~qiskit_machine_learning.circuit.library.qnn_circuit` and
    :meth:`~qiskit_machine_learning.circuit.library.raw_feature_vector`
    respectively.

    Please note that, as mentioned earlier above, the same same restriction
    on the number of qubits applies to these methods too, i.e. it must be
    known/specified when the circuit is created and cannot be changed later.

    Also where an algorithm might default to one of these Blueprint-based
    classes, e.g. VQC, any such defaults have been changed to use the
    replacement methods instead, where later adjustment of the circuit's
    number of qubits is not possible. In such cases if the number of qubits
    given to the algorithm does not match what is needed from the circuit
    and it cannot be adjusted then an exception will be raised.
