deprecations:
  - |
    Qiskit has deprecated its circuit library classes that were based on
    `BlueprintCircuit` in favor of methods that construct the circuits but
    where the number of qubits is fixed and cannot be adjusted later. For
    example `RealAmplitudes` class is replaced by `real_amplitudes` method,
    `ZZFeatureMap` by `zz_feature_map` etc.

    As BlueprintCircuit will be removed from Qiskit similarly based classes
    here are now deprecated. This is
    :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.circuit.library.QNNCircuit` and
    :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.circuit.library.RawFeatureVector` that
    are replaced by methods
    :meth:`~qiskit_machine_learning.circuit.library.qnn_circuit` and
    :meth:`~qiskit_machine_learning.circuit.library.raw_feature_vector
    respectively.

    Please note that, as mentioned earlier above, the same same restriction
    on the number of qubits applies, i.e. it must be known/specified when
    the circuit is created and cannot be changed later.

    Also where an algorithm might default to one of these Blueprint-based
    classes, e.g. VQC, all such defaults have been changed to use the
    replacement methods instead where later adjustment of the circuit's
    number of qubits is not possible. In such cases if the number of qubits
    given to the algorithm does not match what is needed from the circuit
    and it cannot be adjusted then an exception will be raised.
