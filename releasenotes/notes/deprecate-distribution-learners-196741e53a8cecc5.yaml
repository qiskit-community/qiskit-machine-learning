deprecations:
  - |
    The `qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.distribution_learners` package is deprecated and will
    be removed no sooner than 3 months after the release. There's no direct replacement for the
    classes from this package. Instead, please refer to the new QGAN tutorial. This tutorial
    introduces step-by-step how to build a PyTorch-based QGAN using quantum neural networks.
