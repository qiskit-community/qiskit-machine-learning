    The class ``TrainableModel``, and its sub-classes ``NeuralNetworkClassifier``, ``NeuralNetworkRegressor``, ``VQR``, 
    ``VQC``, have a new optional argument ``callback``. User can optionally provide a callback function that can access 
    the intermediate training data to track the optimization process, else it defaults to ``None``. The callback function 
    takes in two parameters: the weights for the objective function and the computed objective value. For each iteration
    an optimizer invokes the callback and passes current weights and computed value of the objective function.
