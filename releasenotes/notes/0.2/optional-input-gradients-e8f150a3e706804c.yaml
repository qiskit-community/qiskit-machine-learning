    Computation of gradients with respect to input data in the backward method of ``NeuralNetwork``
    is now optional. By default gradients are not computed. They may inspected and turned on,
    if required, by getting or setting a new property ``input_gradients`` in
    the ``NeuralNetwork`` class.
