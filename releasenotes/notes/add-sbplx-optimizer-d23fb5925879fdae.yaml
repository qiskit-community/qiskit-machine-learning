    Support for :class:`.SBPLX` optimizer from NLopt library has been added.
    SBPLX is a local gradient-free optimizer based on Nelder-Mead and
    is expected to show better convergence behavior.
    Further information about this optimizer and the others can be found in
    the API ref for the :mod:`~qiskit_machine_learning.optimizers`.
