    Objective functions constructed by the neural network classifiers and regressors now include an
    averaging factor that is evaluated as ``1 / number_of_samples``. Computed averaged objective
    values are passed to a user specified callback if any. Users may notice a dramatic decrease
    in the objective values in their callbacks. This is due to this averaging factor.
