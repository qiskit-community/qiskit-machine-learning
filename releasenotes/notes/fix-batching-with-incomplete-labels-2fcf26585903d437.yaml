    Previously, VQC would throw an error if trained on batches of data where
    not all of the target labels that can be found in the full dataset were
    present. This is because VQC interpreted the number of unique targets in
    the current batch as the number of classes. Currently, VQC is hard-coded
    to expect one-hot-encoded targets. Therefore, VQC will now determine the
    number of classes from the shape of the target array.
