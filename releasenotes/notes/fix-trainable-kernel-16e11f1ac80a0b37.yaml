    Fixed a bug in :class:`.TrainableFidelityQuantumKernel` and
    :class:`.TrainableFidelityStatevectorKernel` where not passing a feature map
    (or explicitly passing None to do the equivalent) would fail internally with
    a NoneType AttributeError as described by
    `issue 911 <https://github.com/qiskit-community/qiskit-machine-learning/issues/911>`__.
