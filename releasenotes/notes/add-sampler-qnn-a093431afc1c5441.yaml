    Introduced Sampler Quantum Neural Network
    (:class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.SamplerQNN`) based on (runtime) primitives.
    This implementation leverages the sampler primitive
    (see :class:`~qiskit.primitives.BaseSampler`) and the sampler gradients
    (see :class:`~qiskit.algorithms.gradients.BaseSamplerGradient`) to enable runtime access and
    more efficient computation of forward and backward passes more efficiently.

    The new Sampler QNN exposes a similar interface to the Circuit QNN, with a few differences.
    One is the `quantum_instance` parameter. This parameter does not have a direct replacement,
    and instead the `sampler` parameter must be used. The `gradient` parameter keeps the same name
    as in the Circuit QNN implementation, but it no longer accepts Opflow gradient classes as inputs;
    instead, this parameter expects an (optionally custom) primitive gradient. The `sampling` option
    has been removed for the time being, as this information is not currently exposed by the `Sampler`,
    and might correspond to future lower-level primitives.

    The existing training algorithms such as :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.VQC`,
    that were based on the Circuit QNN, are updated to accept both implementations. The implementation
    of :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.NeuralNetworkClassifier` has not changed.

    For example a `VQC` using `SamplerQNN` can be trained as follows:

    .. code-block:: python

      from qiskit.circuit.library import ZZFeatureMap, RealAmplitudes
      from qiskit.algorithms.optimizers import COBYLA
      from qiskit.primitives import Sampler
      from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs

      from qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms import VQC

      # generate a simple dataset
      num_inputs = 20
      features, labels = make_blobs(n_samples=num_inputs, centers=2, center_box=(-1, 1), cluster_std=0.1)

      # construct feature map
      feature_map = ZZFeatureMap(num_inputs)

      # construct ansatz
      ansatz = RealAmplitudes(num_inputs, reps=1)

      # construct variational quantum classifier
      vqc = VQC(
        sampler=sampler,
        feature_map=feature_map,
        ansatz=ansatz,
        loss="cross_entropy",
        optimizer=COBYLA(maxiter=30),
      )

      # fit classifier to data
      vqc.fit(features, labels)
