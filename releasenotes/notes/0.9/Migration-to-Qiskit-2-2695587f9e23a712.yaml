    This release migrates Qiskit Machine Learning to be compatible with Qiskit 2.x
    and updates the library's simulation primitives and documentation accordingly.
features:
  - |
    **Introduced QML wrapper primitives** for testing and prototyping:
    :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.primitives.QMLSampler` and
    :class:`qiskit_machine_learning.primitives.QMLEstimator`.
    The associated documentation page explains the behavior of these QML primitives and provides
    examples on when to use it and when, instead, other primitives are recommended. These
    primitives are fully V2-compatible and dedicated to classical simulations of circuits.
    QML primitives have two simulation modes:

    * **Exact mode (deterministic):** computes results from the full statevector (no sampling noise).
    * **Statevector fallback (optional shot noise):** delegates to Qiskit’s statevector primitives
      when shots/precision are requested.

    The docs include examples for:

    * ``QMLEstimator(default_precision=0)`` for exact mode and ``default_precision>0`` for shot-noise mode.
    * ``QMLSampler(shots=None)`` for exact mode and finite ``shots`` for shot-noise mode.

    **Qiskit Machine Learning paired with Qiskit IBM Runtime primitives V2 (docs).** The primitives
    documentation now explicitly points users to ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` primitives for hardware
    execution and includes a session-based example illustrating kernel training / kernel
    alignment style workflows with Runtime primitives.
upgrade:
  - |
    **Qiskit 2.x migration (V2 primitives-first):** Qiskit Machine Learning is updated to work with
    Qiskit’s V2 primitives ecosystem (PUB-based execution and structured results).

    Several commonly used feature maps and ansatze from
    :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` have transitioned from class-based
    constructors to functional constructors. Qiskit Machine Learning now
    follows this updated API. Due to this, the default ``ZZFeatureMap(2)``
    is removed when a feature map is not provided.

    The most common changes from Qiskit are:

    * ``ZZFeatureMap`` -> ``zz_feature_map``
    * ``ZFeatureMap`` -> ``z_feature_map``
    * ``PauliFeatureMap`` -> ``pauli_feature_map``
    * ``RealAmplitudes`` -> ``real_amplitudes``
    * ``EfficientSU2`` -> ``efficient_su2``

    From this version, these changes are reflected in Qiskit Machine Learning as:

    * ``QNNCircuit`` (class) -> ``qnn_circuit`` (function)
fixes:
  - |
    Hashing of :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` objects used internally
    by Qiskit Machine Learning is now deterministic. This improves stability
    and reproducibility in workflows that rely on circuit hashing, caching,
    or dictionary-based storage of circuits.

    **Remove duplicate import in classifiers package init:** ``QSVC`` is no longer imported twice in
    ``qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.classifiers``.
