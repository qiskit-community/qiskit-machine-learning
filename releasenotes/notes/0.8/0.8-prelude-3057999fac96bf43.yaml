    From this release, Qiskit Machine Learning requires Qiskit `1.0` or above, with important
    changes and upgrades, such as the introduction of Quantum Bayesian inference and the migration
    of a subset of Qiskit Algorithms features to Qiskit Machine Learning. These changes are
    part of the process to build full compatibility with the version-2 (V2) Qiskit primitives
    available from version `0.8` of Qiskit Machine Learning. V1 primitives are deprecated and
    will be removed from version `0.9` (please find more information below).
