fixes:
  - |
    Added a `max_circuits_per_job` parameter to the :class:`.FidelityQuantumKernel` used
    in the case that if more circuits are submitted than the job limit for the 
    backend, the circuits are split up and run through separate jobs.
  - |    
    Removed :class:`.QuantumKernelTrainer` dependency on `copy.deepcopy` that was
    throwing an error with real backends. Now, it modifies the :class:`.TrainableKernel`
    in place. If you would like to use the initial kernel, please call 
    :meth:`~.TrainableKernel.assign_training_parameters` of the :class:`~.TrainableKernel`
    using the :attr:`~.QuantumKernelTrainer.initial_point` attribute of 
    :class:`~.QuantumKernelTrainer`.
