    Fixes an issue for the Quantum Neural Networks where the binding order of the inputs
    and weights might end up being incorrect. Though the params for the inputs and weights
    are specified to the QNN, the code previously bound the inputs and weights in the order
    given by the circuit.parameters. This would end up being the right order for the Qiskit
    circuit library feature maps and ansatzes most often used, as the default parameter
    names led to the order being as expected. However for custom names etc. this was not
    always the case and then led to unexpected behavior. The sequences for the input and
    weights parameters, as supplied, are now always used as the binding order, for the inputs
    and weights respectively, such that the order of the parameters in the overall circuit
    no longer matters.
