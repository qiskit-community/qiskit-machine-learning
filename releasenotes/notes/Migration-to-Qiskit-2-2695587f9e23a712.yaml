    This release migrates Qiskit Machine Learning to be compatible with Qiskit 2.x
    and updates the library’s simulation primitives and documentation accordingly.
features:
  - |
    **Documented QML “wrapper” primitives for simulation workflows:** A new primitives API page
    explains that QML primitives are thin wrappers around Qiskit Statevector primitives (V2),
    providing two simulation modes:

    * **Exact mode (deterministic):** computes results from the full statevector (no sampling noise).
    * **Statevector fallback (optional shot noise):** delegates to Qiskit’s statevector primitives
      when shots/precision are requested.

    The docs include examples for:

    * ``QMLEstimator(default_precision=0)`` for exact mode and ``default_precision>0`` for shot-noise mode.
    * ``QMLSampler(shots=None)`` for exact mode and finite ``shots`` for shot-noise mode. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

  - |
    **IBM Runtime primitives guidance (docs):** The primitives documentation now explicitly points users
    to ``qiskit-ibm-runtime`` primitives for hardware execution and includes a session-based example
    (least-busy backend selection) illustrating kernel training / kernel alignment style workflows
    with Runtime primitives.
upgrade:
  - |
    **Qiskit 2.x migration (V2 primitives-first):** Qiskit Machine Learning is updated to work with
    Qiskit’s V2 primitives ecosystem (PUB-based execution and structured results).
  - |
    Several commonly used feature maps and ansätze from
    :mod:`qiskit.circuit.library` have transitioned from class-based
    constructors to functional constructors. Qiskit Machine Learning now
    follows this updated API.

    The most common changes are:

    * ``ZZFeatureMap`` -> ``zz_feature_map``
    * ``ZFeatureMap`` -> ``z_feature_map``
    * ``PauliFeatureMap`` -> ``pauli_feature_map``
    * ``RealAmplitudes`` -> ``real_amplitudes``
    * ``EfficientSU2`` -> ``efficient_su2``
fixes:
  - |
    Hashing of :class:`qiskit.circuit.QuantumCircuit` objects used internally
    by Qiskit Machine Learning is now deterministic. This improves stability
    and reproducibility in workflows that rely on circuit hashing, caching,
    or dictionary-based storage of circuits.
  - |
    **Remove duplicate import in classifiers package init:** ``QSVC`` is no longer imported twice in
    ``qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.classifiers``.
