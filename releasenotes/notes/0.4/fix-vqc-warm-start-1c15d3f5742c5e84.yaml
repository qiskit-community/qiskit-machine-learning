    Fixes an issue where ``VQC`` would fail with ``warm_start=True``.
    The extraction of the ``initial_point`` in ``TrainableModel`` from the final
    point of the minimization had not been updated to reflect the refactor
    of optimizers in ``qiskit-terra``; the old ``optimize`` method, that returned
    a tuple was deprecated and new method ``minimize`` was created that returns
    an ``OptimizerResult`` object. We now correctly recover the final point of
    the minimization from previous fits to use for a warm start in subsequent
    fits.
