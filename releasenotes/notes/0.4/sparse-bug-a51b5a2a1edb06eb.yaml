    Fixed a bug when a sparse array is passed to ``VQC`` as labels. Sparse arrays can be easily
    observed when labels are encoded via ``OneHotEncoder`` from ``SciKit-Learn``. Now both
    ``NeuralNetworkClassifier`` and ``VQC`` support sparse arrays and convert them dense arrays in
    the implementation.
