    Added support for saving and loading machine learning models. This support is introduced in
    ``TrainableModel``, so all sub-classes can be saved and loaded. Also, kernel based models can
    be saved and loaded. A list of models that support saving and loading models:

    * ``NeuralNetworkClassifier``
    * ``NeuralNetworkRegressor``
    * ``VQC``
    * ``VQR``
    * ``QSVC``
    * ``QSVR``
    * ``PegasosQSVC``

    When model is saved all model parameters are saved to a file, including a quantum instance
    that is referenced by internal objects. That means if a model is loaded from a file and is
    used, for instance, for inference, the same quantum instance and a corresponding backend
    will be used even if a cloud backend was used.
