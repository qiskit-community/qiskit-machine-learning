    Fixed a bug in ``QuantumKernel`` where for statevector simulator
    all circuits were constructed and transpiled at once, leading to high memory
    usage. Now the circuits are batched similarly to how it was prevously
    done for non-statevector simulators (same flag is used for both now;
    previously ``batch_size`` was silently ignored by statevector simulator)
