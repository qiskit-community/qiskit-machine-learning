    There's an additional transpilation step introduced in CircuitQNN that is invoked when
    a quantum instance is set. A circuit passed to ``CircuitQNN`` is transpiled and saved for
    subsequent usages. So, every time when the circuit is executed it is already transpiled and
    overall time of the forward pass is reduced. Due to implementation limitations of
    ``RawFeatureVector`` it can't be transpiled in advance, so it is transpiled every time
    it is required to be executed and only when all parameters are bound. This means overall
    performance when ``RawFeatureVector`` is used stays the same.
