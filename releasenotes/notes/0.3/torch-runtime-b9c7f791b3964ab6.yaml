    Introduce the :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.runtime.TorchRuntimeClient` for training
    a quantum model or a hybrid quantum-classical model faster using Qiskit Runtime.
    It can also be used for predicting the result using the trained model
    or calculating the score of the trained model faster using Qiskit Runtime.
