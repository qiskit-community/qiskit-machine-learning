Installation
============

Qiskit Machine Learning depends on the main Qiskit package which has its own
`Qiskit Getting Started <https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html>`__ detailing the
installation options for Qiskit and its supported environments/platforms. You should refer to
that first. Then the information here can be followed which focuses on the additional installation
specific to Qiskit Machine Learning.

Qiskit Machine Learning has some functions that have been made optional where the dependent code and/or
support program(s) are not (or cannot be) installed by default. Those are PyTorch and Sparse.
See :ref:`optional_installs` for more information.

    .. tab-item:: Start locally

        The simplest way to get started is to follow the `getting started 'Start locally' guide for
        Qiskit <https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html>`__

        In your virtual environment where you installed Qiskit simply add ``machine-learning`` to the
        extra list in a similar manner to how the extra ``visualization`` support is installed for
        Qiskit, i.e:

        .. code:: sh

            pip install qiskit[machine-learning]

        It is worth pointing out that if you're a zsh user (which is the default shell on newer
        versions of macOS), you'll need to put ``qiskit[machine-learning]`` in quotes:

        .. code:: sh

            pip install 'qiskit[machine-learning]'


    .. tab-item:: Install from source

       Installing Qiskit Machine Learning from source allows you to access the most recently
       updated version under development instead of using the version in the Python Package
       Index (PyPI) repository. This will give you the ability to inspect and extend
       the latest version of the Qiskit Machine Learning code more efficiently.

       Since Qiskit Machine Learning depends on Qiskit, and its latest changes may require new or changed
       features of Qiskit, you should first follow Qiskit's `"Install from source"` instructions
       here `Qiskit Getting Started <https://qiskit.org/documentation/getting_started.html>`__

          <h2>Installing Qiskit Machine Learning from Source</h2>

       Using the same development environment that you installed Qiskit in you are ready to install
       Qiskit Machine Learning.

       1. Clone the Qiskit Machine Learning repository.

          .. code:: sh

             git clone https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-machine-learning.git

       2. Cloning the repository creates a local folder called ``qiskit-machine-learning``.

          .. code:: sh

             cd qiskit-machine-learning

       3. If you want to run tests or linting checks, install the developer requirements.

          .. code:: sh

             pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

       4. Install ``qiskit-machine-learning``.

          .. code:: sh

             pip install .

       If you want to install it in editable mode, meaning that code changes to the
       project don't require a reinstall to be applied, you can do this with:

       .. code:: sh

          pip install -e .


.. _optional_installs:

Optional installs
=================

* **PyTorch**, may be installed either using command ``pip install 'qiskit-machine-learning[torch]'`` to install the
  package or refer to PyTorch `getting started <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`__. When PyTorch
  is installed, the `TorchConnector` facilitates its use of quantum computed networks.

* **Sparse**, may be installed using command ``pip install 'qiskit-machine-learning[sparse]'`` to install the
  package. Sparse being installed will enable the usage of sparse arrays/tensors.
