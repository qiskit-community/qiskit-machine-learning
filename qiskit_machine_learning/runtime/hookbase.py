class HookBase:
    """
    Base class for hooks that can be registered in ``Trainer``.
    Each hook can implement 6 methods. The way they are called is demonstrated
    in the following snippet:
    ```
        hook.before_train()
        for epoch in range(epochs):
            hook.before_epoch()
            for batch in train_loader:
                hook.before_step()
                trainer.run_step()
                hook.after_step()
            hook.after_epoch()
        hook.after_train()
    ```
    In the hook method, users can access ``self.trainer`` to access more
    properties about the context (e.g., model, current iteration, or config).
