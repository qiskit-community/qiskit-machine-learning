class SVCLoss(KernelLoss):
    r"""
    This class provides a kernel loss function for classification tasks by fitting an ``SVC`` model
    from scikit-learn. Given training samples, :math:`x_{i}`, with binary labels, :math:`y_{i}`,
    and a kernel, :math:`K_{θ}`, parameterized by values, :math:`θ`, the loss is defined as:

    .. math::

        SVCLoss = \sum_{i} a_i - 0.5 \sum_{i,j} a_i a_j y_{i} y_{j} K_θ(x_i, x_j)

    where :math:`a_i` are the optimal Lagrange multipliers found by solving the standard SVM
    quadratic program. Note that the hyper-parameter ``C`` for the soft-margin penalty can be
    specified through the keyword args.

    Minimizing this loss over the parameters, :math:`θ`, of the kernel is equivalent to maximizing a
    weighted kernel alignment, which in turn yields the smallest upper bound to the SVM
    generalization error for a given parameterization.
