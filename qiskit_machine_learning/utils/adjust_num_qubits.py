    Derives a correct number of qubits, feature map, and ansatz from the parameters.

    With `use_methods` set False (default):

    If the number of qubits is not ``None``, then the feature map and ansatz are adjusted to this
    number of qubits if required. If such an adjustment fails, an error is raised. Also, if the
    feature map or ansatz or both are ``None``, then :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.ZZFeatureMap`
    and :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RealAmplitudes` are created respectively. If there's just
    one qubit, :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.ZFeatureMap` is created instead.

    If the number of qubits is ``None``, then the number of qubits is derived from the feature map
    or ansatz. Both the feature map and ansatz in this case must have the same number of qubits.
    If the number of qubits of the feature map is not the same as the number of qubits of
    the ansatz, an error is raised. If only one of the feature map and ansatz are ``None``, then
    :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.ZZFeatureMap` or :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RealAmplitudes`
    are created respectively.

    Returns:
        A tuple of number of qubits, feature map, and ansatz. All are not none.
