        Args:
            num_qubits: The number of qubits for the underlying QNN.
                If ``None`` then the number of qubits is derived from the
                feature map or ansatz, but if neither of these are given an error is raised.
                The number of qubits in the feature map and ansatz are adjusted to this
                number if required.
            feature_map: The (parametrized) circuit to be used as a feature map for the underlying
                QNN. If ``None`` the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.ZZFeatureMap`
                is used if the number of qubits is larger than 1. For a single qubit regression
                problem the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.ZFeatureMap` is used by default.
            ansatz: The (parametrized) circuit to be used as an ansatz for the underlying
                QNN. If ``None`` then the :class:`~qiskit.circuit.library.RealAmplitudes`
                circuit is used.
            observable: The observable to be measured in the underlying QNN. If ``None``,
                use the default :math:`Z^{\otimes num\_qubits}` observable.
            loss: A target loss function to be used in training. Default is squared error.
            optimizer: An instance of an optimizer or a callable to be used in training.
                Refer to :class:`~qiskit_algorithms.optimizers.Minimizer` for more information on
                the callable protocol. When `None` defaults to
                :class:`~qiskit_algorithms.optimizers.SLSQP`.
            warm_start: Use weights from previous fit to start next fit.
            initial_point: Initial point for the optimizer to start from.
            callback: A reference to a user's callback function that has two parameters and
                returns ``None``. The callback can access intermediate data during training.
                On each iteration an optimizer invokes the callback and passes current weights
                as an array and a computed value as a float of the objective function being
                optimized. This allows to track how well optimization / training process is going on.
            estimator: an optional Estimator primitive instance to be used by the underlying
                :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks.EstimatorQNN` neural network. If
                ``None`` is passed then an instance of the reference Estimator will be used.
        Raises:
            QiskitMachineLearningError: Needs at least one out of ``num_qubits``, ``feature_map`` or
                ``ansatz`` to be given. Or the number of qubits in the feature map and/or ansatz
                can't be adjusted to ``num_qubits``.
            ValueError: if the type of the observable is not compatible with ``estimator``.
