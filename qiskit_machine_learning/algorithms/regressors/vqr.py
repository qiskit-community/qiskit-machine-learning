            num_qubits: The number of qubits to be used. If None, and neither feature_map nor
                ansatz are given, it is initially set to 2, i.e., the default of the TwoLayerQNN.
            feature_map: The feature map to be used to construct a TwoLayerQNN. If None, use the
                ZZFeatureMap, i.e., the default of the TwoLayerQNN.
            ansatz: The ansatz to be used to construct a TwoLayerQNN. If None, use the
                RealAmplitudes, i.e., the default of the TwoLayerQNN.
            observable: The observable to be measured in the underlying TwoLayerQNN. If  None, use
                the default from the TwoLayerQNN, i.e., `Z^{\otimes num_qubits}`.
            loss: A target loss function to be used in training. Default is L2.
            optimizer: An instance of an optimizer to be used in training.
            warm_start: Use weights from previous fit to start next fit.

        Raises:
            QiskitMachineLearningError: Neither num_qubits, nor feature_map, nor ansatz given.
