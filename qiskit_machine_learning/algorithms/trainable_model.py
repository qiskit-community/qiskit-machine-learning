        Args:
            neural_network: An instance of an quantum neural network. If the neural network has a
                one-dimensional output, i.e., `neural_network.output_shape=(1,)`, then it is
                expected to return values in [-1, +1] and it can only be used for binary
                classification. If the output is multi-dimensional, it is assumed that the result
                is a probability distribution, i.e., that the entries are non-negative and sum up
                to one. Then there are two options, either one-hot encoding or not. In case of
                one-hot encoding, each probability vector resulting a neural network is considered
                as one sample and the loss function is applied to the whole vector. Otherwise, each
                entry of the probability vector is considered as an individual sample and the loss
                function is applied to the index and weighted with the corresponding probability.
            loss: A target loss function to be used in training. Default is `squared_error`,
                i.e. L2 loss. Can be given either as a string for 'absolute_error' (i.e. L1 Loss),
                'squared_error', 'cross_entropy', 'cross_entropy_sigmoid', or as a loss function
                implementing the Loss interface.
            optimizer: An instance of an optimizer to be used in training. When `None` defaults to SLSQP.
            warm_start: Use weights from previous fit to start next fit.
            initial_point: Initial point for the optimizer to start from.
            callback: a reference to a user's callback function that has two parameters and
                returns ``None``. The callback can access intermediate data during training.
                On each iteration an optimizer invokes the callback and passes current weights
                as an array and a computed value as a float of the objective function being
                optimized. This allows to track how well optimization / training process is going on.
