Quantum neural networks (:mod:`qiskit_machine_learning.neural_networks`)
========================================================================

A neural network is a parametrized network which may be defined as a artificial
neural network - classical neural network - or as parametrized quantum circuits
- quantum neural network. Furthermore, neural networks can be defined with respect
to a discriminative or generative task.

Neural networks may be used, for example, with the
:class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.algorithms.VQC` algorithm.

See also the :class:`~qiskit_machine_learning.connectors.TorchConnector` that allows the
use of these neural networks in code written to `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_.
